# ENES100_Spring_2018
## Project Description

You are a member of an engineering firm that has a contract to design and build a fleet of small, inexpensive vehicles that can be quickly deployed to survey a remote island in the Pacific Ocean where aircraft debris have washed ashore.  The vehicles that your firm designs must be capable of 
* navigating the sandy/rocky terrain
* scouting for, collecting, and analyzing natural resources and aircraft debris
* transmitting data regarding the terrain, natural resources, and aircraft debris encountered back to your design firm for further analysis

Your vehicle will be parachuted onto the surface of the island and will land in a random spot with a random orientation.  From there you will begin communicating with the aircraft command center from which your vehicle was launched and will start your mission.  The command center will be able to track your vehicle and send coordinate and heading information of your vehicle through RF transmissions along with accurate information about most mission sites. 

## Mission
Water Sampling
* Clear rocky terrain
* Navigate to within 250 mm of the edge of the water pool
* Measure and correctly transmit whether the water is fresh, salt or polluted water	
* Measure and transmit the depth of the water in the pool to within 4 mm	
* Collect a sample of 30 â€“ 45 ml of water from the pool
